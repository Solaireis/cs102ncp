Compile the file
javac com/example/alpha/Test.java
javac com/example/beta/Test.java

Execute the file
java -cp com/example/alpha Test
java -cp com/example/beta Test

Only execute the first entry it finds
java -cp com/example/beta:com/example/alpha Test

It will execute beta because thats the first directory it found
