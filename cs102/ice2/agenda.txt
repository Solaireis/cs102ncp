At the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
1. Declare instance attributes with appropriate access modifiers 
   (private vs. public) and predict their default values.
2. Differentiate between the memory allocation of primitive types 
   and reference types (including the significance of null).
3. Implement constructors, including the use of the this keyword 
   to resolve shadowing. 
4. Contrast the behavior of a compiler-generated no-arg constructor 
   versus a user-defined constructor. 
5. Execute object instantiation using the new keyword and 
   assign the resulting reference to a variable. 
6. Develop instance methods to define object behavior and invoke 
   them using dot notation. 
7. Compare and contrast the output of printing an object reference 
   directly versus calling the .toString() method. 
8. Justify the use of the static keyword for variables and methods 
   in specific programming scenarios. 
9. Interpret the Java API documentation to identify necessary 
   constructors and method signatures for a given class.
